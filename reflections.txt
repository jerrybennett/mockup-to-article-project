You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

 -- Please note: This module was added after I had started the course. So I have finished most of the other projects already. I believe this and the next project are optional for me but I will complete them both.

  * What new skills have you learned?

  How to find information online about the tools and language I am using.

  * What has been easy?

  Finding the information I need.

  * What has been difficult?

  Sometimes implementing solutions. Some of the "documentation" sections of a javascript tool may be sparse on "code examples." So I find myself spending a lot more time looking for and doing tutorials and searching forums for discussions on the topic.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  Checking the documentation for HTML5.
